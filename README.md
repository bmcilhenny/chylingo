###### Chylingo! Teach D.J. Rumpus some Chinese words before his big state visit to People's Republic of Chyna.

After getting rejected from Flatiron's in-person bootcamp in June, I knew I had to create something awesome. 

Something that a) worked but more importantly b) summarized my personality and c) was fun to build.

I knew when I had applied for Flatiron in July I was devoted to becoming a Software Engineer but with no projects under my belt and not even the slightest clue what Github or stackoverflow was 
I had nothing to show to my devotion.

After graduating from college I move to Beijing where I worked for a small tech company focused on bringing 
UN-style interpretation to the business world. Why Beijing? I had been studying Chinese since Sophomore year of highschool 
and studied abroad in the fall of '13 and figured there's only one place in the world to practice Chinese: Beijing, not only
the capital city and cultural hub of China but the city with the most authentic, standard Mandarin accent. 

- I have always loved languages, something about enveloping yourself in a culture so much that you start speaking in the local language, almost like becoming another person. Seeing the world from their perspective, learning the social queues of a society so foreign to mine.

- I love entertainment. Animation, comedy, drama, fiction. I love the power of emotion, the way people's moods can change in an instant because of the right combination of color, sound and words.

- I also love politics. I studied economics at university as well as asian studies. I loved the intersection of politics and 
economics because it is the closest thing one can get to predicting the future. Also, I enjoy being informed and learning from others so when it comes a time where politics is brought up in conversation I can hopefully supply some value to the discussion.

Sitting in front of the tube one evening going through some Chinese lessons on an app similar to the language learning app
Duolingo (urghh!!! Duolingo doesn't even offer the most spoken language in the world, Mandarin!) while simultaneously listening to Don Lemon drone on and on about how much of a baffoon Trump was that day that it hit me, a mini app for my Flatiron application was born. CHYLINGO!

Chylingo captures my ever-growing list of passions: learning, laughing and creating.

I designed all of the graphics, dialogue and the overall lesson concept you see in Chylingo. I wanted to teach an authentic phrase in Chinese because at the end of the lesson I hope the user can realize that Chinese is very simple and straightforward. Much like coding, at first the weird characters seem daunting but a step at a time and things start to make more and more sense. I can assure you that after 8+ years of studying Chinese, the Chinese you learn in this lesson can be 
directly utilized in the real world. In other words, Chinese people will actually understand what you are saying. 

When creating anything, authenticity is key. That's why I tried to make the overall storyline behind Chylingo as authentic as possible: I actually think the sentence taught is something our current President would actually say to China's President/Premier
Xi Jinping.

To conclude, I hope this app can bring you a chuckle. The world is a crazy place, the best medicine will forever be humor.
